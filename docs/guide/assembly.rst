Hip Assembly
-------------

Step 1. Install disc 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Video Instructions: https://youtu.be/aUnK3Wvj8CU
*  Materials: M3x6mm socket head screw, servo disc, loctite, servo arm (to adjust servo motor)
*   Tools: 2.5mm hex driver

Instructions:

1. Attach a servo horn (not disc) to the servo and turn the servo into its neutral position and then remove the servo horn
2. Align the servo disc on the servo shaft so that the disc holes are roughly at 45 degree marks (see picture below)
3. Put a tiny dab of loctite on the screw
4. Gently start threading the screw in and then continue to screw it in, this will cause the disc to sink onto the servo spline (the output shaft)
5. Some of the servo discs are poorly manufactured, so if this is the case for you, it’s expected that it’ll take a lot of torque to start threading the screw. At some point however, the servo disc will finish deforming to fit the shaft and it’ll become a lot easier to screw on. When the disc is fully seated, you’ll again see an increase in torque and you should stop. Do not over-tighten the screw once the disc is fully seated or you risk breaking the servo motor.

Step 2. Install the M3 threaded insert into the inner hip piece
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* No Video Available 
*  Materials: Assembly so far, M3 tapered threaded insert
*   Tools: Soldering iron

Instructions:

1. Place the insert into the hole with the tapered side down
2. Set the soldering iron to around 500f or 260c and then gently press the insert into the plastic. I recommend just using the weight of the iron to press the insert in, and I also suggest doing it in steps, ie pressing it in 1mm, taking the iron out, then pressing another 1mm etc into it is all the way in. This method prevents the soldering iron from getting stuck to the iron.

Setting up the insert for insertion. The actual 3D printed part in the picture is outdated, but the insertion is still the same.

Step 1. Install tapered threaded heat inserts into 3D printed parts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* No Video Available  
*  Materials: M3 tapered heat-set inserts for plastic x16, 4 body pieces
*   Tools: Soldering iron set to around 500f / 260c

Instructions: 

1. Each of the 3D printed body pieces have four holes — two on top and two on bottom that hold the tapered heat-set inserts for plastic
2. Place the insert into the hole with the tapered side down
3. Use a soldering iron set to around 500f or 260c to gently press the insert into the plastic. I recommend just using the weight of the iron to press the insert in, and I also suggest doing it in steps, ie pressing it in 1mm, taking the iron out, then pressing another 1mm etc into it is all the way in. This method prevents the soldering iron from getting stuck to the iron.

2. Plug the servo cables into the custom circuit board in this pattern shown below. 

J1 through J12 correspond to one of the twelve sets of header pins soldered to the circuit board. The circuit board has indicators for how to align the signal, ground, and positive wires from the servo motors into the board, but in case they’re too hard to see, you can know that the signal pins on the servo connectors always face towards the Raspberry Pi header.

PCB Assembly 
--------------

Step 1: Solder the servo connector headers to the board
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* No Video Available
*  Materials: PCB, 12 male headers of 3 pins each
*   Tools: Soldering iron, preferably a nice one with >=60W heat output.

Instructions:

1. Place each of the 12 male header pins into their respective slots as shown in the photo. 
2. Then, turn the board upside down so you have access to solder the underside. Be careful that the headers don’t all fall out when you turn the board over. When I did this, I pressed a hard foam block up against the top side of the pins to make sure they didn't tilt or fall out when I turned the board over. You’ll also want to check that the pins are mostly perpendicular to the board after you turn the board over.  
3. Once the board is turned over, solder all of the signal pins to keep the headers in place. The signal pins are the pins closest to the Raspberry Pi header pin holes (the 2x20 array). 
4. Once the headers are all tacked into place, solder the remaining ground and positive pins.

Placed all the pins into the board unsoldered

Step 2: Solder the Raspberry Pi header pin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* No Video Available
*  Materials: PCB, 2x20 raspberry pi header pin
*   Tools: Soldering iron

Instructions:

1. Insert the 2x20 header pin into the PCB. Make sure that you insert the header from the bottom so that the pins are coming out the top. This will allow the header to sit on top of the Raspberry Pi.
2. Secure the PCB and header pin in a vice
3. Solder the header pins in from the top.

Step 3: Solder the bec and 5V in pins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* No Video Available
*  Materials: PCB, header pins
*   Tools: Soldering iron, vice

Instructions: 

1. Snap off a pair of 1x2 header pins and solder them to the areas labelled Vbat and Regulated 5V. Important: If you do not have a dupont/jst crimps and crimper on hand, then do not solder pins to the Vbat holes.

Step 4: Solder the XT 60 pigtail connector to the PCB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* No Video Available
*  Materials: PCB, XT60 pigtail connector
*   Tools: Soldering iron, vice

Instructions:

1. Insert the xt 60 pigtail from the top and solder from the bottom. Make sure you get the polarity correct! The PCB has little labels for the + and - wires of the xt 60 pigtail.

Step 5: Test the power distribution board for shorts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* No Video Available
*  Materials: PCB
*   Tools: Multimeter

Instructions: 

1. Inspect the board visually to make sure no solder blobs are shorting together
2. Turn the multimeter to the short detecting setting. This is usually indicated by a little speaker icon. 
3. Test that the + and - pins of the xt 60 connector do not short together
4. Test that none of the signal wires short to + or - either. 
5. Test that none of the signal wires short to each other.

Step 6: Test for servo power
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* No Video Available
*  Materials: PCB, servos
*   Tools: none

Instructions: 

1. Plug in your 2S lipo (never plug in anything more than 8.4V or it’s very likely you’ll burn out your servos)
2. Connect in a single servo into the board, noting the labels for the signal, -, and + wires. On servos, the signal wire is usually yellow or white. 
3. Reference picture to determine correct wire orientation. 
4. If the servo doesn’t start smoking when you plug it in, good job!
5. Unplug the servo and battery for now.

.. image:: ../_static/pcb6.jpg
    :align: center

Step 7: Plug in the 5V voltage regulator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* No Video Available
*  Materials: PCB, 5V regulator (BEC)
*   Tools: Soldering iron or crimper

Instructions: 

1. We use a 5V BEC to reduce the 7.4-8.4V voltage from the battery to 5V for the Raspberry Pi. The 5V output of the BEC has a JST connector which mates nicely with the Regulated 5V in pins you soldered in step 4. 
2. The input side of the BEC has a male JST connector which you should now snip off. 
3. You can either strip these input wires and solder them to the Vbat holes directly, or you can crimp female dupont headers to the wires, put them in a 1x2 housing, and plug the wires into the Vbat pins.

Done!
