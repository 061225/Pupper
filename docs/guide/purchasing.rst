You can buy most of the parts directly from a reseller like 
Amazon or McMaster-Carr, but for some you’ll need to get them 
custom manufactured for you. The custom parts include the carbon 
fiber routed parts, the 3D printed parts, the power distribution 
printed circuit board, and the motors. The BOM spreadsheet goes 
into much more detail.

Pre-Made Kits
--------------
If you’d like to skip the soldering steps and have all the components 
directly shipped to you, you can buy a kit from Cypress Software 
(not affiliated with Stanford Robotics). 
Their kits cost about 15-20% more than if you bought everything yourself. 
They also have an option to purchase a completely pre-assembled robot.
