Part Sourcing
==================

Pre-Made Kits
--------------
Two small businesses are now selling Pupper kits. 
Both vendors sell a variety of types of kits, from partially complete to fully assembled. 
Buying a kit instead of purchasing the parts yourself will most likely save you money.
Check out both websites to see which kit best suits your needs.

If you'd like to source the parts yourself follow the 
instructions in the BOM. Most of the parts can be bought
directly from a reseller like 
Amazon or McMaster-Carr, but for some youâ€™ll need to get them 
custom manufactured for you. The custom parts include the carbon 
fiber routed parts, the 3D printed parts, the power distribution 
printed circuit board, and the motors. The BOM spreadsheet goes 
into much more detail.
