You can buy most of the parts directly from a reseller like 
Amazon or McMaster-Carr, but for some youâ€™ll need to get them 
custom manufactured for you. The custom parts include the carbon 
fiber routed parts, the 3D printed parts, the power distribution 
printed circuit board, and the motors. The BOM spreadsheet goes 
into much more detail.

Pre-Made Kits
--------------
Two small businesses are now selling Pupper kits. Both sell complete Pupper kits as well as fully assembled robots. Cypress Software also sells partially complete kits. Check out both websites to see which kit best suits your needs.
