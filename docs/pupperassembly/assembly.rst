Hip Assembly
-------------

Step 1. Install disc 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Video Instructions 0:17
*  Materials: M3x6mm socket head screw, servo disc, loctite, servo arm (to adjust servo motor), 

M3x6 socket head screw: 

*   Tools: 2.5mm hex driver

Instructions:

1. Attach a servo horn (not disc) to the servo and turn the servo into its neutral position and then remove the servo horn
2. Align the servo disc on the servo shaft so that the disc holes are roughly at 45 degree marks (see picture below)
3. Put a tiny dab of loctite on the screw
4. Gently start threading the screw in and then continue to screw it in, this will cause the disc to sink onto the servo spline (the output shaft)
5. Some of the servo discs are poorly manufactured, so if this is the case for you, it’s expected that it’ll take a lot of torque to start threading the screw. At some point however, the servo disc will finish deforming to fit the shaft and it’ll become a lot easier to screw on. When the disc is fully seated, you’ll again see an increase in torque and you should stop. Do not over-tighten the screw once the disc is fully seated or you risk breaking the servo motor.

Step 2. Install the M3 threaded insert into the inner hip piece
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* No Video Available 
*  Materials: Assembly so far, M3 tapered threaded insert
*   Tools: Soldering iron

Instructions:

1. Place the insert into the hole with the tapered side down
2. Set the soldering iron to around 500f or 260c and then gently press the insert into the plastic. I recommend just using the weight of the iron to press the insert in, and I also suggest doing it in steps, ie pressing it in 1mm, taking the iron out, then pressing another 1mm etc into it is all the way in. This method prevents the soldering iron from getting stuck to the iron.

.. Setting up the insert for insertion. The actual 3D printed part in the picture is outdated, but the insertion is still the same.

Body Assembly
--------------

Step 1. Install tapered threaded heat inserts into 3D printed parts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Video Instructions 
*  Materials: M3 tapered heat-set inserts for plastic x16, 4 body pieces
*   Tools: Soldering iron set to around 500f / 260c

Instructions: 

1. Each of the 3D printed body pieces have four holes — two on top and two on bottom that hold the tapered heat-set inserts for plastic
2. Place the insert into the hole with the tapered side down
3. Use a soldering iron set to around 500f or 260c to gently press the insert into the plastic. I recommend just using the weight of the iron to press the insert in, and I also suggest doing it in steps, ie pressing it in 1mm, taking the iron out, then pressing another 1mm etc into it is all the way in. This method prevents the soldering iron from getting stuck to the iron.

Instructions:

1. Plug the servo cables into the custom circuit board in this pattern shown below. 

J1 through J12 correspond to one of the twelve sets of header pins soldered to the circuit board. The circuit board has indicators for how to align the signal, ground, and positive wires from the servo motors into the board, but in case they’re too hard to see, you can know that the signal pins on the servo connectors always face towards the Raspberry Pi header.
