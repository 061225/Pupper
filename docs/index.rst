Welcome to Pupper's documentation!
==================================


About Pupper
*************

Stanford Pupper is a 3lb quadruped robot that can trot, hop, and 
run around. We hope that its low-cost and simple design will allow 
robot enthusiasts in K-12 and beyond to get their hands dirty with 
fun, dynamic robots.

You can buy most of the parts directly from a reseller like 
Amazon or McMaster-Carr, but for some you’ll need to get them 
custom manufactured for you. The custom parts include the carbon 
fiber routed parts, the 3D printed parts, the power distribution 
printed circuit board, and the motors. The BOM spreadsheet goes 
into much more detail.
